    "summary": "python-jinja2 security update",
    "details": "Jinja2 is one of the most used template engines for Python. It is inspired by Django\u0026apos;s templating system but extends it with an expressive language that gives template authors a more powerful set of tools. On top of that it adds sandboxed execution and optional automatic escaping for applications where security is important.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThis affects the package jinja2 from 0.0.0 and before 2.11.3. The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly due to the `_punctuation_re regex` operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The last wildcard is the most exploitable as it searches for trailing punctuation. This issue can be mitigated by Markdown to format user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing request timeouts and limiting process memory.(CVE-2020-28493)",
