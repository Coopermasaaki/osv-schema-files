    "details": "\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming languages rely heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular expressions have exponential or cubic worst-case complexity and are vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can cause a denial of service.(CVE-2021-27291)\r\n\r\nAn infinite loop in SMLLexer in Pygments versions 1.5 to 2.7.3 may lead to denial of service when performing syntax highlighting of a Standard ML (SML) source file, as demonstrated by input that only contains the \u0026quot;exception\u0026quot; keyword.(CVE-2021-20270)",
