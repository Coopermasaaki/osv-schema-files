Such a tool is often referred to as a network analyzer, network protocol analyzer or sniffer.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn Wireshark 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, 2.6.0 to 2.6.8, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.14, the dissection engine could crash. This was addressed in epan/packet.c by restricting the number of layers and consequently limiting recursion.(CVE-2019-12295)",
