    "details": "Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). The main package includes the libvirtd server exporting the virtualization support.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn improper locking issue was found in the virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath API of libvirt. It occurs in the storagePoolLookupByTargetPath function where a locked virStoragePoolObj object is not properly released on ACL permission failure. Clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to acquire the lock and prevent other users from accessing storage pool/volume APIs, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3667)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in libvirt while it generates SELinux MCS category pairs for VMs\u0026apos; dynamic labels. This flaw allows one exploited guest to access files labeled for another guest, resulting in the breaking out of sVirt confinement. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.(CVE-2021-3631)",
