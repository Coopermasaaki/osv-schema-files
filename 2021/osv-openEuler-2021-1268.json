    "details": "OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format originally developed by Industrial Light \u0026amp; Magic for use in computer imaging applications.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThere\u0026apos;s a flaw in OpenEXR\u0026apos;s ImfDeepScanLineInputFile functionality in versions prior to 3.0.5. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to an application linked with OpenEXR could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk from this flaw is to application availability.(CVE-2021-3598)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. Because of integer overflows in CompositeDeepScanLine::Data::handleDeepFrameBuffer and readSampleCountForLineBlock, an attacker can write to an out-of-bounds pointer.(CVE-2020-11759)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before v2.5.2. Invalid chunkCount attributes could cause a heap buffer overflow in getChunkOffsetTableSize() in IlmImf/ImfMisc.cpp.(CVE-2020-15306)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an std::vector out-of-bounds read and write, as demonstrated by ImfTileOffsets.cpp.(CVE-2020-11763)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds read during Huffman uncompression, as demonstrated by FastHufDecoder::refill in ImfFastHuf.cpp.(CVE-2020-11761)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an off-by-one error in use of the ImfXdr.h read function by DwaCompressor::Classifier::Classifier, leading to an out-of-bounds read.(CVE-2020-11765)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds read during RLE uncompression in rleUncompress in ImfRle.cpp.(CVE-2020-11760)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.5.2. Invalid input could cause a use-after-free in DeepScanLineInputFile::DeepScanLineInputFile() in IlmImf/ImfDeepScanLineInputFile.cpp.(CVE-2020-15305)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds read in ImfOptimizedPixelReading.h.(CVE-2020-11758)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds write in copyIntoFrameBuffer in ImfMisc.cpp.(CVE-2020-11764)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds read and write in DwaCompressor::uncompress in ImfDwaCompressor.cpp when handling the UNKNOWN compression case.(CVE-2020-11762)",
