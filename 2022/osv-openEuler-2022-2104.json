    "details": "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. This package provides the essential shared library for any PostgreSQL client program or interface.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in PostgreSQL. There is an issue with incomplete efforts to operate safely when a privileged user is maintaining another user\u0026apos;s objects. The Autovacuum, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, CLUSTER, and pg_amcheck commands activated relevant protections too late or not at all during the process. This flaw allows an attacker with permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema to execute arbitrary SQL functions under a superuser identity.(CVE-2022-1552)",
