    "details": "The GNOME Display Manager is a system service that is responsible for providing graphical log-ins and managing local and remote displays, and if the session doesn\u0026apos;t provide a display server, GDM will start the display server. It also provides initiate functionality for user-switching, so multiple users can be logged in at the same time.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in GDM in versions prior to 3.38.2.1. A race condition in the handling of session shutdown makes it possible to bypass the lock screen for a user that has autologin enabled, accessing their session without authentication. This is similar to CVE-2017-12164, but requires more difficult conditions to exploit.(CVE-2020-27837)",
