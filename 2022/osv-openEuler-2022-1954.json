    "details": "This software is also called Modsec,it is an open-source web application firewall. It is designed for Apache HTTP Server.ModSecurity is commonly deployed to provide protections against generic classed of vulnerabilities.The install of this package is easy and you can read the README.TXT for more information.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.5 mishandles excessively nested JSON objects. Crafted JSON objects with nesting tens-of-thousands deep could result in the web server being unable to service legitimate requests. Even a moderately large (e.g., 300KB) HTTP request can occupy one of the limited NGINX worker processes for minutes and consume almost all of the available CPU on the machine. Modsecurity 2 is similarly vulnerable: the affected versions include 2.8.0 through 2.9.4.(CVE-2021-42717)",
