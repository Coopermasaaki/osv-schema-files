The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20300)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in OpenEXR\u0026apos;s TiledInputFile functionality. This flaw allows an attacker who can submit a crafted single-part non-image to be processed by OpenEXR, to trigger a floating-point exception error. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20302)\r\n\r\nAn integer overflow could occur when OpenEXR processes a crafted file on systems where size_t \u0026lt; 64 bits. This could cause an invalid bytesPerLine and maxBytesPerLine value, which could lead to problems with application stability or lead to other attack paths.(CVE-2021-3933)",
