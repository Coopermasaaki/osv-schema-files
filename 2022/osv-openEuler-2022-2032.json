This vulnerability affects the function inet6_stream_ops/inet6_dgram_ops of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211090 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3567)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992.(CVE-2022-3649)\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service.(CVE-2022-3586)",
