In this issue, curl can be asked to tunnel all protocols virtually it supports through an HTTP proxy. HTTP proxies can deny these tunnel operations using an appropriate HTTP error response code. When getting denied to tunnel the specific SMB or TELNET protocols, curl can use a heap-allocated struct after it has been freed and shut down the code path in its transfer.(CVE-2022-43552)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3","name":"curl","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/curl&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"7.71.1-20.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["curl-7.71.1-20.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-20.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-20.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-20.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-20.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["curl-help-7.71.1-20.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["curl-7.71.1-20.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libcurl-7.71.1-20.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-20.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-20.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-20.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-20.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1006"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43552"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
