The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in the service accountâ€™s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and the kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation are used together with containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2024-3177)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1","name":"kubernetes","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kubernetes&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"1.20.2-21.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["kubernetes-help-1.20.2-21.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kubernetes-kubelet-1.20.2-21.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kubernetes-client-1.20.2-21.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kubernetes-master-1.20.2-21.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kubernetes-node-1.20.2-21.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kubernetes-kubeadm-1.20.2-21.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kubernetes-1.20.2-21.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kubernetes-1.20.2-21.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["kubernetes-kubeadm-1.20.2-21.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kubernetes-1.20.2-21.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kubernetes-node-1.20.2-21.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kubernetes-kubelet-1.20.2-21.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kubernetes-master-1.20.2-21.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kubernetes-client-1.20.2-21.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kubernetes-help-1.20.2-21.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1550"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3177"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Low"}}
