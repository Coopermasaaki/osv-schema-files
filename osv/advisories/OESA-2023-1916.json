You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Varnish Cache 7.x before 7.1.2 and 7.2.x before 7.2.1. A request smuggling attack can be performed on Varnish Cache servers by requesting that certain headers are made hop-by-hop, preventing the Varnish Cache servers from forwarding critical headers to the backend.(CVE-2022-45059)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2","name":"varnish","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/varnish&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["varnish-debuginfo-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","varnish-debugsource-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","varnish-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","varnish-devel-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["varnish-help-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["varnish-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["varnish-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","varnish-debugsource-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","varnish-debuginfo-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","varnish-devel-7.0.1-9.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1916"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45059"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
