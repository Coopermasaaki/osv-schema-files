This makes it suitable for &quot;machine to machine&quot; messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or micro-controllers like the Arduino.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn Mosquitto before 2.0.16, a memory leak occurs when clients send v5 CONNECT packets with a will message that contains invalid property types.\n(CVE-2023-3592)\r\n\r\nIn Eclipse Mosquito before and including 2.0.5, establishing a connection to the mosquitto server without sending data causes the EPOLLOUT event to be added, which results excessive CPU consumption. This could be used by a malicious actor to perform denial of service type attack. This issue is fixed in 2.0.6\r\n\r\n\n(CVE-2023-5632)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1","name":"mosquitto","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/mosquitto&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["mosquitto-devel-2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","mosquitto-2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","mosquitto-debuginfo-2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","mosquitto-debugsource-2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["mosquitto-2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["mosquitto-debugsource-2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","mosquitto-devel-2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","mosquitto-2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","mosquitto-debuginfo-2.0.16-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1773"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3592"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5632"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
