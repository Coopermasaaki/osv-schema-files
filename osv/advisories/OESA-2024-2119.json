It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThere is a MEDIUM severity vulnerability affecting CPython.\r\n\r\nThe \nemail module didnâ€™t properly quote newlines for email headers when \nserializing an email message allowing for header injection when an email\n is serialized.(CVE-2024-6923)\r\n\r\nThere is a LOW severity vulnerability affecting CPython, specifically the\n&apos;http.cookies&apos; standard library module.\r\n\r\n\nWhen parsing cookies that contained backslashes for quoted characters in\nthe cookie value, the parser would use an algorithm with quadratic\ncomplexity, resulting in excess CPU resources being used while parsing the\nvalue.(CVE-2024-7592)\r\n\r\nThere is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython &quot;zipfile&quot;\nmodule affecting &quot;zipfile.Path&quot;. Note that the more common API &quot;zipfile.ZipFile&quot; class is unaffected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods\nof &quot;zipfile.Path&quot; like &quot;namelist()&quot;, &quot;iterdir()&quot;, etc)\nthe process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted\nzip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting\nthe contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handling\nuser-controlled zip archives are not affected.(CVE-2024-8088)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4","name":"python3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2119"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6923"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7592"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8088"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
