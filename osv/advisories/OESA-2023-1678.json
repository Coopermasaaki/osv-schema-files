Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and digital signatures. OpenSC implements the standard APIs to smart cards, e.g. PKCS#11 API, Windowsâ€™ Smart Card Minidriver and macOS Tokend.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA vulnerbility was found in OpenSC. This security flaw cause a buffer overrun vulnerability in pkcs15 cardos_have_verifyrc_package. The attacker can supply a smart card package with malformed ASN1 context. The cardos_have_verifyrc_package function scans the ASN1 buffer for 2 tags, where remaining length is wrongly caculated due to moved starting pointer. This leads to possible heap-based buffer oob read. In cases where ASAN is enabled while compiling this causes a crash. Further info leak or more damage is possible.(CVE-2023-2977)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3","name":"opensc","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/opensc&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"0.20.0-11.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["opensc-debugsource-0.20.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","opensc-0.20.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","opensc-debuginfo-0.20.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["opensc-help-0.20.0-11.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["opensc-0.20.0-11.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["opensc-debugsource-0.20.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","opensc-debuginfo-0.20.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","opensc-0.20.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1678"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2977"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
