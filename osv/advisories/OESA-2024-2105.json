It is freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence. In style it is similar to Smail 3, but its facilities are more general. There is a great deal of flexibility in the way mail can be routed, and there are extensive facilities for checking incoming mail. Exim can be installed in place of sendmail, although the configuration of exim is quite different to that of sendmail.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nExim through 4.97.1 misparses a multiline RFC 2231 header filename, and thus remote attackers can bypass a $mime_filename extension-blocking protection mechanism, and potentially deliver executable attachments to the mailboxes of end users.(CVE-2024-39929)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4","name":"exim","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/exim&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"4.96-4.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["exim-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","exim-clamav-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","exim-debuginfo-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","exim-debugsource-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","exim-greylist-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","exim-mon-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","exim-mysql-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","exim-pgsql-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["exim-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["exim-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","exim-clamav-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","exim-debuginfo-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","exim-debugsource-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","exim-greylist-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","exim-mon-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","exim-mysql-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","exim-pgsql-4.96-4.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2105"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39929"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
