It is freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence. In style it is similar to Smail 3, but its facilities are more general. There is a great deal of flexibility in the way mail can be routed, and there are extensive facilities for checking incoming mail. Exim can be installed in place of sendmail, although the configuration of exim is quite different to that of sendmail.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nExim before 4.97.1 allows SMTP smuggling in certain PIPELINING/CHUNKING configurations. Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because Exim supports &lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; but some other popular e-mail servers do not.(CVE-2023-51766)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-24.03-LTS","name":"exim","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/exim&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"4.97.1-2.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["exim-4.97.1-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","exim-debugsource-4.97.1-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","exim-greylist-4.97.1-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","exim-debuginfo-4.97.1-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","exim-mysql-4.97.1-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","exim-mon-4.97.1-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","exim-pgsql-4.97.1-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","exim-clamav-4.97.1-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["exim-4.97.1-2.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["exim-greylist-4.97.1-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","exim-clamav-4.97.1-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","exim-pgsql-4.97.1-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","exim-debuginfo-4.97.1-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","exim-mysql-4.97.1-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","exim-mon-4.97.1-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","exim-4.97.1-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","exim-debugsource-4.97.1-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/security-bulletins/detail?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1928"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51766"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
