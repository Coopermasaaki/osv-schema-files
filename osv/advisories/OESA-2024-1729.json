It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, protocols, and buffers.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\niPerf3 before 3.17, when used with OpenSSL before 3.2.0 as a server with RSA authentication, allows a timing side channel in RSA decryption operations. This side channel could be sufficient for an attacker to recover credential plaintext. It requires the attacker to send a large number of messages for decryption, as described in &quot;Everlasting ROBOT: the Marvin Attack&quot; by Hubert Kario.(CVE-2024-26306)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-24.03-LTS","name":"iperf3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/iperf3&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"3.16-3.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["iperf3-3.16-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","iperf3-debugsource-3.16-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","iperf3-debuginfo-3.16-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","iperf3-devel-3.16-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["iperf3-help-3.16-3.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["iperf3-3.16-3.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["iperf3-devel-3.16-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","iperf3-3.16-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","iperf3-debuginfo-3.16-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","iperf3-debugsource-3.16-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1729"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26306"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Low"}}
