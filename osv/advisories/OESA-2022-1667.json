Hawk used a regular expression to parse Host HTTP header (Hawk.utils.parseHost()), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker s input increases the computation time exponentially. parseHost() was patched in 9.0.1 to use built-in URL class to parse hostname instead. Hawk.authenticate() accepts options argument. If that contains host and port, those would be used instead of a call to utils.parseHost().(CVE-2022-29167)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1","name":"nodejs-hawk","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/nodejs-hawk&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"4.1.2-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["nodejs-hawk-4.1.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["nodejs-hawk-4.1.2-2.oe1.src.rpm"]}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3","name":"nodejs-hawk","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/nodejs-hawk&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"4.1.2-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["nodejs-hawk-4.1.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["nodejs-hawk-4.1.2-2.oe1.src.rpm"]}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS","name":"nodejs-hawk","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/nodejs-hawk&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"4.1.2-2.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["nodejs-hawk-4.1.2-2.oe2203.noarch.rpm"],"src":["nodejs-hawk-4.1.2-2.oe2203.src.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1667"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29167"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
