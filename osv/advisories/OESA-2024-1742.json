The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python interpreter or any modules.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nPyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access to. A user is affected if **all** the following are satisfied: 1. The user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or `win32com`. 2. The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with higher privileges than the attacker). 3. The user&apos;s temporary directory is not locked to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location). Either: A. The attacker is able to very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink. This switch must occur exactly between `shutil.rmtree()`&apos;s builtin symlink check and the deletion itself B: The application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against Directory Junctions links. The vulnerability has been addressed in PR #7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller &gt;= 5.13.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.(CVE-2023-49797)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-24.03-LTS","name":"python-pyinstaller","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-pyinstaller&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"5.13.0-2.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python-pyinstaller-debuginfo-5.13.0-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python-pyinstaller-debugsource-5.13.0-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python-pyinstaller-help-5.13.0-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-pyinstaller-5.13.0-2.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["python-pyinstaller-5.13.0-2.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python-pyinstaller-debuginfo-5.13.0-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python-pyinstaller-help-5.13.0-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python-pyinstaller-debugsource-5.13.0-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-pyinstaller-5.13.0-2.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1742"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49797"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
