It has been developed in order to promote the use of JPEG 2000, a still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). Since April 2015, it is officially recognized by ISO/IEC and ITU-T as a JPEG 2000 Reference Software.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThere is a flaw in the opj2_compress program in openjpeg2. An attacker who is able to submit a large number of image files to be processed in a directory by opj2_compress, could trigger a heap out-of-bounds write due to an integer overflow, which is caused by the large number of image files. The greatest threat posed by this flaw is to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.(CVE-2021-29338)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1","name":"openjpeg2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/openjpeg2&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"2.3.1-7.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["openjpeg2-2.3.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openjpeg2-debugsource-2.3.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openjpeg2-debuginfo-2.3.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openjpeg2-devel-2.3.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["openjpeg2-help-2.3.1-7.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["openjpeg2-2.3.1-7.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["openjpeg2-2.3.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openjpeg2-debugsource-2.3.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openjpeg2-debuginfo-2.3.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openjpeg2-devel-2.3.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2","name":"openjpeg2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/openjpeg2&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"2.3.1-7.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["openjpeg2-debugsource-2.3.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openjpeg2-devel-2.3.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openjpeg2-2.3.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openjpeg2-debuginfo-2.3.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["openjpeg2-help-2.3.1-7.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["openjpeg2-2.3.1-7.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["openjpeg2-debugsource-2.3.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openjpeg2-2.3.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openjpeg2-debuginfo-2.3.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openjpeg2-devel-2.3.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1363"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29338"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
