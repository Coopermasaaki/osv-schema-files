It provides a simple C language application programming interface (API) to access the secure communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12, and other required structures.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in GnuTLS before 3.6.15. A server can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in a TLS 1.3 client if a no_renegotiation alert is sent with unexpected timing, and then an invalid second handshake occurs. The crash happens in the application's error handling path, where the gnutls_deinit function is called after detecting a handshake failure.(CVE-2020-24659)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS","name":"gnutls","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/gnutls&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"3.6.14-6.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["gnutls-devel-3.6.14-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-debugsource-3.6.14-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-debuginfo-3.6.14-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-3.6.14-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["gnutls-help-3.6.14-6.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["gnutls-3.6.14-6.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["gnutls-devel-3.6.14-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-3.6.14-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-debuginfo-3.6.14-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-debugsource-3.6.14-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1046"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24659"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
