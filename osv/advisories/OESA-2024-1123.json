The complete control of the client is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily, without third-party programs others than libcrypto (from openssl).\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in libssh. By utilizing the ProxyCommand or ProxyJump feature, users can exploit unchecked hostname syntax on the client. This issue may allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the command of the features mentioned through the hostname parameter.(CVE-2023-6004)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2","name":"libssh","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libssh&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libssh-debugsource-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","libssh-devel-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","libssh-debuginfo-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","libssh-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libssh-help-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libssh-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libssh-debugsource-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","libssh-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","libssh-devel-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","libssh-debuginfo-0.9.6-8.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1123"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6004"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
