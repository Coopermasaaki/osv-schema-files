It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string; incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set. In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log. Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split and so forth. Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like a cache. You can use Redis from most programming languages also.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nRedis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. When using the Redis Lua Debugger, users can send malformed requests that cause the debuggerâ€™s protocol parser to read data beyond the actual buffer. This issue affects all versions of Redis with Lua debugging support (3.2 or newer). The problem is fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.(CVE-2021-32672)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1","name":"redis6","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/redis6&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"6.2.7-1.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["redis6-6.2.7-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","redis6-devel-6.2.7-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","redis6-debuginfo-6.2.7-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","redis6-debugsource-6.2.7-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["redis6-doc-6.2.7-1.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["redis6-6.2.7-1.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["redis6-devel-6.2.7-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","redis6-6.2.7-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","redis6-debugsource-6.2.7-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","redis6-debuginfo-6.2.7-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3","name":"redis6","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/redis6&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"6.2.7-1.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["redis6-devel-6.2.7-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","redis6-debugsource-6.2.7-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","redis6-debuginfo-6.2.7-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","redis6-6.2.7-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["redis6-doc-6.2.7-1.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["redis6-6.2.7-1.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["redis6-6.2.7-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","redis6-debuginfo-6.2.7-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","redis6-devel-6.2.7-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","redis6-debugsource-6.2.7-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS","name":"redis6","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/redis6&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"6.2.7-1.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["redis6-6.2.7-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","redis6-devel-6.2.7-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","redis6-debuginfo-6.2.7-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","redis6-debugsource-6.2.7-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["redis6-doc-6.2.7-1.oe2203.noarch.rpm"],"src":["redis6-6.2.7-1.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["redis6-devel-6.2.7-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","redis6-debugsource-6.2.7-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","redis6-6.2.7-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","redis6-debuginfo-6.2.7-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1866"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32672"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
