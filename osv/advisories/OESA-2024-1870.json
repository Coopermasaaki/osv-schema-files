In addition, OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure tunneling \\ capabilities, several authentication methods, and sophisticated configuration options.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH&apos;s server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd&apos;s SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.(CVE-2024-6409)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1","name":"openssh","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/openssh&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["openssh-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-askpass-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-clients-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-debuginfo-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-debugsource-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-keycat-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-server-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","pam_ssh_agent_auth-0.10.4-4.32.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["openssh-help-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["openssh-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["openssh-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-askpass-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-clients-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-debuginfo-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-debugsource-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-keycat-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-server-8.8p1-32.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","pam_ssh_agent_auth-0.10.4-4.32.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1870"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6409"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
