It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIt&apos;s possible for a gRPC client communicating with a HTTP/2 proxy to poison the HPACK table between the proxy and the backend such that other clients see failed requests. It&apos;s also possible to use this vulnerability to leak other clients HTTP header keys, but not values.\r\n\r\nThis occurs because the error status for a misencoded header is not cleared between header reads, resulting in subsequent (incrementally indexed) added headers in the first request being poisoned until cleared from the HPACK table.\r\n\r\nPlease update to a fixed version of gRPC as soon as possible. This bug has been fixed in 1.58.3, 1.59.5, 1.60.2, 1.61.3, 1.62.3, 1.63.2, 1.64.3, 1.65.4.(CVE-2024-7246)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-24.03-LTS","name":"grpc","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/grpc&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"1.60.0-4.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["grpc-1.60.0-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","grpc-debuginfo-1.60.0-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","grpc-debugsource-1.60.0-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","grpc-devel-1.60.0-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","grpc-plugins-1.60.0-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-grpcio-1.60.0-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["grpc-1.60.0-4.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["grpc-1.60.0-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","grpc-debuginfo-1.60.0-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","grpc-debugsource-1.60.0-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","grpc-devel-1.60.0-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","grpc-plugins-1.60.0-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-grpcio-1.60.0-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2064"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7246"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
