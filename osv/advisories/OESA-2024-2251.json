In affected versions clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded_For). Any users relying on proxy set variables is affected. v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the non-underscore version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy defined headers to always win. Users are advised to upgrade. Nginx has a underscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard these headers at the proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting the proxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so until upgraded to the fixed versions.(CVE-2024-45614)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-24.03-LTS","name":"rubygem-puma","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/rubygem-puma&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"5.6.5-3.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["rubygem-puma-5.6.5-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","rubygem-puma-debuginfo-5.6.5-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","rubygem-puma-debugsource-5.6.5-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["rubygem-puma-doc-5.6.5-3.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["rubygem-puma-5.6.5-3.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["rubygem-puma-5.6.5-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","rubygem-puma-debuginfo-5.6.5-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","rubygem-puma-debugsource-5.6.5-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2251"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45614"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
