It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core (~1 Byte/cycle). A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is available, trading customizable CPU time for compression ratio.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThere s a flaw in lz4. An attacker who submits a crafted file to an application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow, leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an out-of-bounds write and/or a crash. The greatest impact of this flaw is to availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity as well.(CVE-2021-3520)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1","name":"lz4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/lz4&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"1.9.2-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["lz4-devel-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","lz4-debuginfo-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","lz4-debugsource-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","lz4-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["lz4-help-1.9.2-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["lz4-1.9.2-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["lz4-debugsource-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","lz4-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","lz4-devel-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","lz4-debuginfo-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1245"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3520"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
