The pesign package provides a systemd service used to start the pesign daemon. This service unit runs a script to set ACLs for /etc/pki/pesign and /run/pesign directories to grant access privileges to users in the &apos;pesign&apos; group. However, the script doesn&apos;t check for symbolic links. This could allow an attacker to gain access to privileged files and directories via a path traversal attack.(CVE-2022-3560)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1","name":"pesign","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/pesign&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"0.113-5.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["pesign-debuginfo-0.113-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","pesign-help-0.113-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","pesign-0.113-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","pesign-debugsource-0.113-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["pesign-0.113-5.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["pesign-debuginfo-0.113-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","pesign-0.113-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","pesign-help-0.113-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","pesign-debugsource-0.113-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3","name":"pesign","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/pesign&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"0.113-5.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["pesign-help-0.113-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","pesign-debugsource-0.113-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","pesign-0.113-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","pesign-debuginfo-0.113-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["pesign-0.113-5.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["pesign-0.113-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","pesign-help-0.113-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","pesign-debuginfo-0.113-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","pesign-debugsource-0.113-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS","name":"pesign","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/pesign&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"0.113-6.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["pesign-help-0.113-6.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","pesign-0.113-6.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","pesign-debuginfo-0.113-6.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","pesign-debugsource-0.113-6.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["pesign-0.113-6.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["pesign-debuginfo-0.113-6.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","pesign-0.113-6.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","pesign-debugsource-0.113-6.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","pesign-help-0.113-6.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1119"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3560"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
