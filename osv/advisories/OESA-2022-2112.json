This package provides the client applications xfreerdp and wlfreerdp.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing path canonicalization and base path check for `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read files outside the shared directory. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `/drive`, `/drives` or `+home-drive` redirection switch.(CVE-2022-39347)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. In affected versions there is an out of bound read in ZGFX decoder component of FreeRDP. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read out of bound data and try to decode it likely resulting in a crash. This issue has been addressed in the 2.9.0 release. Users are advised to upgrade.(CVE-2022-39316)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing input length validation in the `urbdrc` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read out of bound data and send it back to the server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `/usb` redirection switch.(CVE-2022-39319)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients.
