It's a real-time compression scenario for zlib levels and has a better compression ratio.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nBeginning in v1.4.1 and prior to v1.4.9, due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-24031, the Zstandard command-line utility created output files with default permissions and restricted those permissions immediately afterwards.
