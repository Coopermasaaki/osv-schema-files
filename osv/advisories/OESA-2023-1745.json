For handling of the parsed data a convenient API is available.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nlibcue provides an API for parsing and extracting data from CUE sheets. Versions 2.2.1 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. A user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by downloading a cue sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is saved to `~/Downloads`, it is then automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners use libcue to parse the file. The file exploits the vulnerability in libcue to gain code execution. This issue is patched in version 2.3.0.(CVE-2023-43641)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1","name":"libcue","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libcue&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libcue-devel-2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libcue-2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libcue-debugsource-2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libcue-debuginfo-2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libcue-2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libcue-devel-2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","libcue-debugsource-2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","libcue-debuginfo-2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","libcue-2.2.1-2.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1745"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43641"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
