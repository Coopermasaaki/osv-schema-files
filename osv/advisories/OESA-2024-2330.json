It provides a wide variety of basic cryptographic algorithms, X.509 certificates and CRLs, PKCS \\#10 certificate requests, a filter/pipe message processing system, and a wide variety of other features, all written in portable C++. The API reference, tutorial, and examples may help impart the flavor of the library. This is the current stable release branch 2.x of Botan.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nBotan before 3.6.0, when certain LLVM versions are used, has compiler-induced secret-dependent control flow in lib/utils/ghash/ghash.cpp in GHASH in AES-GCM.
