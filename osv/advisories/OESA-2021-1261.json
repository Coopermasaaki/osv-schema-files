NOTE: it could be argued that because expat already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed, and each affected application would need its own CVE.(CVE-2013-0340)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1","name":"expat","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/expat&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"2.2.9-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["expat-debugsource-2.2.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","expat-2.2.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","expat-devel-2.2.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","expat-debuginfo-2.2.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["expat-help-2.2.9-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["expat-2.2.9-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["expat-debuginfo-2.2.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","expat-debugsource-2.2.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","expat-2.2.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","expat-devel-2.2.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1261"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-0340"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
