CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) to support printing to local and network printers..\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nCUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libppd` can be used for legacy PPD file support. The `libppd` function `ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2` does not sanitize IPP attributes when creating the PPD buffer. When used in combination with other functions such as `cfGetPrinterAttributes5`, can result in user controlled input and ultimately code execution via Foomatic.
