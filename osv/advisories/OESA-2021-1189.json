It is designed to be lightweight and have a small footprint, suitable for resource constrained routers and firewalls. It has also been widely used for tethering on smartphones and portable hotspots, and to support virtual networking in virtualisation frameworks.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.(CVE-2021-3448)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1","name":"dnsmasq","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/dnsmasq&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"2.82-8.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["dnsmasq-debugsource-2.82-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","dnsmasq-help-2.82-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","dnsmasq-2.82-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","dnsmasq-debuginfo-2.82-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["dnsmasq-2.82-8.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["dnsmasq-2.82-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","dnsmasq-debugsource-2.82-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","dnsmasq-help-2.82-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","dnsmasq-debuginfo-2.82-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1189"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3448"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Low"}}
