When handling the tag esi:when when ESI is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This function uses a fixed stack buffer to hold the expression while its being evaluated. When processing the expression, it could either evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new member, there is no check to ensure that the stack wont overflow.(CVE-2019-12519)\\r\\n\\r\\n","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS","name":"squid","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/squid&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"4.9-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.src.rpm","squid-4.9-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1","name":"squid","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/squid&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"4.9-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1020"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12519"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
