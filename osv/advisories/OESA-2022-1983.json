BIND includes a DNS server (named), which resolves host names to IP addresses; a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating properly.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nBy sending specific queries to the resolver, an attacker can cause named to crash.(CVE-2022-3080)\r\n\r\nBy spoofing the target resolver with responses that have a malformed ECDSA signature, an attacker can trigger a small memory leak. It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.(CVE-2022-38177)\r\n\r\nBy spoofing the target resolver with responses that have a malformed EdDSA signature, an attacker can trigger a small memory leak. It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.(CVE-2022-38178)\r\n\r\nBy flooding the target resolver with queries exploiting this flaw an attacker can significantly impair the resolver&apos;s performance, effectively denying legitimate clients access to the DNS resolution service.(CVE-2022-2795)\r\n\r\nThe underlying bug might cause read past end of the buffer and either read memory it should not read, or crash the process.(CVE-2022-2881)\r\n\r\nAn attacker can leverage this flaw to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.
