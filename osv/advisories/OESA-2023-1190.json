Such a tool is often referred to as a network analyzer, network protocol analyzer or sniffer.Wireshark, formerly known as Ethereal, can be used to examine the details of traffic at a variety of levels ranging from connection-level information to the bits that make up a single packet. Packet capture can provide a network administrator with information about individual packets such as transmit time, source, destination, protocol type and header data. This information can be useful for evaluating security events and troubleshooting network security device issues.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nISO 15765 and ISO 10681 dissector crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.3 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.11 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2023-1161)","affected":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1","name":"wireshark","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/wireshark&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["wireshark-debuginfo-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","wireshark-devel-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","wireshark-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","wireshark-debugsource-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","wireshark-help-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["wireshark-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["wireshark-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","wireshark-debuginfo-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","wireshark-help-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","wireshark-devel-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","wireshark-debugsource-3.6.11-2.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1190"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1161"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
