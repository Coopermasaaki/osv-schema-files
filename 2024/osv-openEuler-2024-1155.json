    "details": "ZBar is an open source software suite for reading bar codes from various sources, such as video streams, image files and raw intensity sensors. It supports many popular symbologies (types of bar codes) including EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128, Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA heap-based buffer overflow exists in the qr_reader_match_centers function of ZBar 0.23.90. Specially crafted QR codes may lead to information disclosure and/or arbitrary code execution. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker can digitally input the malicious QR code, or prepare it to be physically scanned by the vulnerable scanner.(CVE-2023-40889)\r\n\r\nA stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the lookup_sequence function of ZBar 0.23.90.
