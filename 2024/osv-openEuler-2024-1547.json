Pagers are often used in command-line environments like the Unix shell and the MS-DOS command prompt to display files.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nless through 653 allows OS command execution via a newline character in the name of a file, because quoting is mishandled in filename.c. Exploitation typically requires use with attacker-controlled file names, such as the files extracted from an untrusted archive. Exploitation also requires the LESSOPEN environment variable, but this is set by default in many common cases.(CVE-2024-32487)",
