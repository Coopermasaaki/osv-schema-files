The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL tookit and its related documentation.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in OpenSSL. Calling the OpenSSL API SSL_free_buffers function may cause memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations.(CVE-2024-4741)",
