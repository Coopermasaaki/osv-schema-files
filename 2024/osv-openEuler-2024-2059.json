    "details": ".\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request with an \u0026quot;Expect: 100-continue\u0026quot; header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status. This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail. An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending \u0026quot;Expect: 100-continue\u0026quot; requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.(CVE-2024-24791)",
