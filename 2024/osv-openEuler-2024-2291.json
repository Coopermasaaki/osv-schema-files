    "details": "NetworkManager attempts to keep an active network connection available at all times.  The point of NetworkManager is to make networking configuration and setup as painless and automatic as possible. If using DHCP, NetworkManager is intended to replace default routes, obtain IP addresses from a DHCP server, and change name servers whenever it sees fit.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in NetworkManager. When a system running NetworkManager with DEBUG logs enabled and an interface eth1 configured with LLDP enabled, a malicious user could inject a malformed LLDP packet. NetworkManager would crash, leading to a denial of service.(CVE-2024-6501)",
