    "details": "Rack provides a minimal, modular, and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web servers,  web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called middleware) into  a single method call.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability in the Range header parsing component of Rack \u0026gt;= 1.5.0. A Carefully crafted input can cause the Range header parsing component in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. Any applications that deal with Range requests (such as streaming applications, or applications that serve files) may be impacted.(CVE-2022-44570)\r\n\r\nThere is a denial of service vulnerability in the Content-Disposition parsingcomponent of Rack fixed in 2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.4.1, 3.0.0.1. This could allow an attacker to craft an input that can cause Content-Disposition header parsing in Rackto take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial ofservice attack vector. This header is used typically used in multipartparsing. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtuallyall Rails applications) are impacted.(CVE-2022-44571)\r\n\r\nRack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Carefully crafted content type headers can cause Rackâ€™s media type parser to take much longer than expected, leading to a possible denial of service vulnerability (ReDos 2nd degree polynomial). This vulnerability is patched in 3.0.9.1 and 2.2.8.1.(CVE-2024-25126)",
