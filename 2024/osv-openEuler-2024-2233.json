    "details": "Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern features based on open standards. To help increase online privacy, Unbound supports DNS-over-TLS which allows clients to encrypt their communication. Unbound is available for most platforms such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MacOS, Linux and Microsoft Windows. Unbound is a totally free, open source software under the BSD license. It doesn\u0026apos;t make custom builds or provide specific features to paying customers only.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe DNS protocol in RFC 1035 and updates allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by arranging for DNS queries to be accumulated for seconds, such that responses are later sent in a pulsing burst (which can be considered traffic amplification in some cases), aka the \u0026quot;DNSBomb\u0026quot; issue.(CVE-2024-33655)",
