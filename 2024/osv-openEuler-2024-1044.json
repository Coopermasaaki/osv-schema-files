    "summary": "libssh security update",
    "details": "The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working SSH implementation by the mean of a library. The complete control of the client is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily, without third-party programs others than libcrypto (from openssl).\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in libssh. By utilizing the ProxyCommand or ProxyJump feature, users can exploit unchecked hostname syntax on the client. This issue may allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the command of the features mentioned through the hostname parameter.(CVE-2023-6004)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the libssh implements abstract layer for message digest (MD) operations implemented by different supported crypto backends. The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection.(CVE-2023-6918)",
