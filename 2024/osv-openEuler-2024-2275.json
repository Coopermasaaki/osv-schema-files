Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://pdf.js` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin PDF content. This access is limited to \u0026quot;same site\u0026quot; documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u0026lt; 131, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 128.3, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 115.16, Thunderbird \u0026lt; 128.3, and Thunderbird \u0026lt; 131.(CVE-2024-9393)\r\n\r\nAn attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://devtools` origin.
