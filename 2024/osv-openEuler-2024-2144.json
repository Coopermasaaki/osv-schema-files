    "details": "gdk is written in C but has been designed from the ground up to support a wide range of languages. It provide a complete set of widgets,and suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka gdk-pixbuf) through 2.42.10, the ANI (Windows animated cursor) decoder encounters heap memory corruption (in ani_load_chunk in io-ani.c) when parsing chunks in a crafted .ani file. A crafted file could allow an attacker to overwrite heap metadata, leading to a denial of service or code execution attack. This occurs in gdk_pixbuf_set_option() in gdk-pixbuf.c.(CVE-2022-48622)",
