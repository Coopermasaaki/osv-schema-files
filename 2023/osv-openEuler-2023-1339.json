It is intended for applications which need to perform DNS queries without blocking, or need to perform multiple\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nc-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When /dev/urandom or RtlGenRandom() are unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate random numbers used for DNS query ids. This is not a CSPRNG, and it is also not seeded by srand() so will generate predictable output. Input from the random number generator is fed into a non-compilant RC4 implementation and may not be as strong as the original RC4 implementation. No attempt is made to look for modern OS-provided CSPRNGs like arc4random() that is widely available. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1.(CVE-2023-31147)",
