    "details": "Qt (pronounced as \u0026quot;cute\u0026quot;, not \u0026quot;cu-tee\u0026quot;) is a cross-platform framework that is usually used as a graphical toolkit, although it is also very helpful in creating CLI applications. It runs on the three major desktop OSes, as well as on mobile OSes, such as Symbian, Nokia Belle, Meego Harmattan, MeeGo or BB10, and on embedded devices. Ports for Android (Necessitas) and iOS are also in development\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIn Qt before 5.15.14, 6.0.x through 6.2.x before 6.2.9, and 6.3.x through 6.5.x before 6.5.1, QtSvg QSvgFont m_unitsPerEm initialization is mishandled.(CVE-2023-32573)",
