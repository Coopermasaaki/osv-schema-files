    "details": "Wireshark is an open source tool for profiling network traffic and analyzing packets. Such a tool is often referred to as a network analyzer, network protocol analyzer or sniffer.Wireshark, formerly known as Ethereal, can be used to examine the details of traffic at a variety of levels ranging from connection-level information to the bits that make up a single packet. Packet capture can provide a network administrator with information about individual packets such as transmit time, source, destination, protocol type and header data. This information can be useful for evaluating security events and troubleshooting network security device issues.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nCrash in the USB HID protocol dissector in Wireshark 3.6.0 to 3.6.8 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file on Windows(CVE-2022-3724)\r\n\r\nMemory exhaustion in the Kafka protocol dissector in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.9 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2022-4344)\r\n\r\nInfinite loops in the BPv6, OpenFlow, and Kafka protocol dissectors in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.9 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2022-4345)\r\n\r\nDissection engine bug in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.2 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.10 and allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2023-0413)\r\n\r\nMemory leak in the NFS dissector in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.2 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.10 and allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2023-0417)\r\n\r\niSCSI dissector crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.2 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.10 and allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2023-0415)\r\n\r\nExcessive loops in multiple dissectors in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.2 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.10 and allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2023-0411)\r\n\r\nTIPC dissector crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.2 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.10 and allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2023-0412)\r\n\r\nGNW dissector crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.2 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.10 and allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2023-0416)",
